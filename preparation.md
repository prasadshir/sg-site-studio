# Preparation

Once you have a list of topics for which you need preparation, you will possibly face two challenges.

1. Find and study documentation and knowledge resources for the topics **and**,
2. Find enough practical case studies covering the topics.

## Knowledge Resources

Finding documentation and online resources is easier. Customers and Partners may register for [**Acquia Academy**](https://customers.acquiaacademy.com) and take a course in the relevant domain to refresh your knowledge. 

If you are new to Site Studio, you should start with a [Getting Started with Site Studio Guide](https://cohesiondocs.acquia.com/6.1/user-guide/getting-started)

After completing the Getting started guide, you may take the following courses from Acquia Academy

* [Acquia Site Studio Product Introduction](https://www.acquiaacademy.com/lms/index.php?r=course/deeplink&course_id=449&hash=8808d6088073cdc287216e194d92dbbb699e971e&generated_by=13030)
* [Acquia Site Studio 6.x Site Building](https://www.acquiaacademy.com/lms/index.php?r=course/deeplink&course_id=473&hash=5e540d8bc92cf187b5a249cc9e29c2041f4cdbc1&generated_by=13030)
* [Planning for a Successful Site Studio Engagement](%20https://www.acquiaacademy.com/lms/index.php?r=course/deeplink&course_id=495&hash=ea0d58c4065b602d9bd72db71c278271bafcb7be&generated_by=13029)

The second challenge of finding enough practical case studies covering the topics is likely to be more daunting. For obtaining adequate hands-on experience, you may request for a [Site Studio Sandbox](https://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-cohesion#create-sandbox) and follow a series of guided [Tutorials](https://cohesiondocs.acquia.com/6.1/tutorials) for a hands-on learning experience. 

If you are stuck with any questions, you may use the [FAQs](https://cohesiondocs.acquia.com/6.1/faqs) page to search for an answer.
