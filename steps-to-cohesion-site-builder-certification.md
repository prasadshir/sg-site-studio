# Steps to Site Studio Site Builder Certification

## Take Acquia Academy Courses

We have two courses to get you started on your Site Studio journey.

* [Acquia Site Studio Product Introduction](https://www.acquiaacademy.com/lms/index.php?r=course/deeplink&course_id=449&hash=8808d6088073cdc287216e194d92dbbb699e971e&generated_by=13030)
* [Acquia Site Studio 6.x Site Building](https://www.acquiaacademy.com/lms/index.php?r=course/deeplink&course_id=473&hash=5e540d8bc92cf187b5a249cc9e29c2041f4cdbc1&generated_by=13030)

After taking the courses, build a small website on your own using Site Studio to reinforce the concepts learned in the courses.

## Gain Practical Experience

Completing the courses will not make you ready for taking the certification exam. You need to have some real-life practical experience to attempt the exam. For this purpose, we recommend that you gain the practical experience by working on at least 2-3 real life projects.

## Perform Self Assessment

Once you decide to take the exam, we recommend that you study the [domains and topics](exam-domains.md) covered by the exam and their relative weights. You should also perform a [Self Assessment](self-assessment.md) of your own areas of strength and weakness vis-a-vis the domains/topics covered by the exam blueprint. This is a recommended starting point for experienced Drupal 8 Developers.

## Use Labs and Study Guide

Based on your Self Assessment, you may need to gain knowledge and experience in some Domains or Topics. The best way to learn Site Studio is by working or experimenting on it. Follow the suggestions given for preparation in the [Preparation](preparation.md) section and refer to the external resources given in the [Study Guide](study-guide.md) section.
