# Test Format

Test item formats used in this examination are:

* Multiple-choice: Examinee selects one option that best answers the question or completes a statement.
* Multiple-response: Examinee selects more than one option that best answers the question or completes a statement.

All the questions asked in the exam are scenario-based. There are three parts to each question: A scenario, a question, and the options.

* A _**scenario**_ describes a situation with a use case or a client requirement on a Drupal site.
* Then a _**question**_ is asked about the scenario or the problem.
* Four or more _**options**_ are given as possible solutions, from which the candidate needs to select the correct answer or answers. Take a look at the sample question:

**Scenario**

You have a requirement from the customer to create a setting whereby a specific element in your component does not render if there is no content available.

**Question**

What setting would you use to manage this?

**Answer Choices**

1. Using the Hide if no data toggle 
2. Setting display: none on the element conditionally 
3. By setting the width of the element to 0 
4. Using the context visibility feature

\(Correct answer - 1\)

After looking at the sample question, you may realize that the questions rely on the application of Drupal/Cohesion concepts and knowledge rather than purely memorizing the facts, code, or syntax.

Reading through long lists of documentation or books is not sufficient for answering most questions. You need experience with a number of use cases, applications, and common scenarios in a Drupal Cohesion project. It will also help to have experience with support requests and issues to handle questions of this nature
